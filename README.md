# Toric Degenerations
This is the repository for the M2-Package "Toric Degenerations".
It requires the packages FourierMotzkin,gfanInterface,gfanInterface2,Binomials,Tropical.
The packages Tropical and gfanInterface2 are available at https://github.com/Macaulay2/Workshop-2016-Warwick/tree/master/Tropical
It contains also some files useful for the proof of the theorems in the paper "Computing toric degenerations of flag varieties".
There will be also a file with the input to give gfan for Flag5 since the tropicalization cannot be done with the Macaulay2 interface(we need to specify the symmetries and this function is not available at the moment).
